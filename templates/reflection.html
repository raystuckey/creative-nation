<p class="flow-text">The development of Creative-Nation seriously considered how best to attract and support the widest and most diverse set of parents and students to participate in it. With a primary focus on developing creative minds, combined with a wealth of experience that informed our decision, the choice of the development of a new nation as a theme for the project seemed most appropriate. The structure of the project, designed around a variety of sessions which build on cumulative creative skills and incorporating a tried and tested design framework, would be its allure and would attract a wide set of students and adults to it. Although the sessions are geared to students in grades 5-8, participation in the project is open to all, with no previous skills required.  In addition, the facilitator is provided with alternatives for differentiated instruction and active engagement. The program is also well suited to delivery at weekends or other boot-camp scenarios.</p><br/><br/>
<p class="flow-text">Furthermore, each session has a ‘take home’ or parent engagement component: an activity which will enlist the involvement of interested adults by eliciting their input and consolidating the child’s creative skills. In an effort to make the program available to as wide an audience as possible, the design of each of the sessions is intended to make it deliverable over one or more sessions, taking into account the pace appropriate for the participants, facilitators and logistical difficulties of time. Additionally, the activities may be completed in a high or low tech mode, again according to the resources that are available. We envision that along with the advertising campaign, consisting of posters and promotional videos, within and outside of school, and its integration within the school-wide learning system and weekly class newsletters and blogs, the self pride and personal satisfaction in developing one's own nation will engender greater interest in the project and encourage others to participate.</p><br/><br/>
<p class="flow-text">The creative thinking skills developed by participants as they progress through the program can clearly be integrated into activities that form part of regular curriculum areas. The skills learned through Dimensional Thinking and Modeling, for example, can clearly be utilized in geometry as students explore a variety of tools and media to help represent their ideas in both 2-dimensions and 3-dimensions while the skills of Recognizing Patterns and Forming Patterns are pertinent to the Language Arts requirement to create a well structured story or cultural myth. It is highly recommended that these creative thinking endeavours, as outlined by Bernstein &amp; Bernstein, be built further into the curriculum as students move through the planned curriculum.</p><br/><br/>
